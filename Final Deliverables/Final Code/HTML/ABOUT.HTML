<BR><BR>CKD is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood as well as they should. Because of this, excess fluid and waste from blood remain in the body and may cause other health problems, such as heart disease and stroke.
<BR><BR>
Some other health consequences of CKD include:
<BR>
1.Anemia or low number of red blood cells<BR>
2.Increased occurrence of infections<BR>
3.Low calcium levels, high potassium levels, and high phosphorus levels in the blood<BR>
4.Loss of appetite or eating less<BR>
5.Depression or lower quality of life<BR><BR><BR>
CKD has varying levels of seriousness. It usually gets worse over time though treatment has been shown to slow progression. If left untreated, CKD can progress to kidney failure and early cardiovascular disease. When the kidneys stop working, dialysis or kidney transplant is needed for survival. Kidney failure treated with dialysis or kidney transplant is called end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Learn more about ESRD.

Not all patients with kidney disease progress to kidney failure. To help prevent CKD and lower the risk for kidney failure, control risk factors for CKD, get tested yearly, make lifestyle changes, take medicine as needed, and see your health care team regularly.
